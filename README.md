# THE PROCRASTINATION PURGER!
Project for SFU FALL HACKS 10h Hackathon on October 15th, 2022 by Valdislav Mironov and Elvin Zukic. In this hackathon we have created the Procrastination Purger,
the perfect tool to help you with your crippling procrastination. It uses advanced algorithms to plan out your study sessions so you will never be studying AT THE LAST MINUTE 
ever again. All you need to do is to input when you are free and any upcoming tests or assignment and it will give you a scheldule detailing exactly when you should study.

To run, download the application folder from github, download Python and the pandas library and finally run the application file.

Unfortunately due to time restraints we have limited the amount of due dates inputtable to 1
and it may also have inconsistent proportions on differents screens due tkinter
