# THE PROCRASTINATION PURGER!
Project for SFU FALL HACKS 10h Hackathon on October 15th, 2022 by Valdislav Mironov and Elvin Zukic. In this hackathon we have created the Procrastination Purger,
the perfect tool to help you with your crippling procrastination. It uses advanced algorithms to plan out your study sessions so you will never be studying AT THE LAST MINUTE 
ever again. All you need to do is to input when you are free and any upcoming tests or assignment and it will give you a scheldule detailing exactly when you should study. Remember to refresh after putting in your availability and due dates

To run, download the application folder from github, download Python and the pandas library and finally run the application file.

First input your time availability in form of HH:MM-HH:MM for each day of the week. e.g. 09:00-15:00
If you are unavailable this day leave it a t 00:00

Next add due date with format specified in the window. Example of date - 10/21/22
Press both refresh buttons and follow the schedule!

Unfortunately due to time restraints we have limited the amount of due dates inputtable to 1
and it may also have inconsistent proportions on differents screens due tkinter. We also have not fully done error handling so please enter valid inputs.
